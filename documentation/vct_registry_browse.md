## Sections in the page

### 1. Scope selector
- **My VCTs** — only items you uploaded (private or public).  
- **Public Catalog** — published VCTs from all users.  
- **All** — merges your VCTs with the public catalog.

### 2. Search bar
- Enter keywords like `address`, `birthdate`, `diploma`.  
- Press **Search** to update results.  
- Press **Reset** to clear the query.  
- Optionally enable **Use AI search** for semantic matching.

### 3. Catalog table
Columns:
- **Name** — linked to the VCT URL.  
- **Description** — short text from the VCT.  
- **Languages** — language codes supported by `display`.  
- **Popularity** — stars, ratings, usage counts.  
- **Visible** — shows whether the entry is *Public* or *Private*.  
- **Actions** — download, copy, change visibility, delete.

### 4. Actions per row
- **Download VCT** — full JSON file.  
- **Schema only** — just the JSON Schema subset.  
- **Copy VCT URL** — copies the permanent identifier.  
- **Copy integrity** — copies the `sha256-…` integrity hash.  
- **Visibility** — toggle *Private/Public* for your own items.  
- **Delete** — remove your own item.  
- **Rate** — click stars to rate a type (1–5). Ratings and call counts appear in the popularity cell.

## Tips & Troubleshooting
- **Empty list** — check the scope or reset the search.  
- **Copy not working** — allow clipboard access (HTTPS recommended).  
- **Upload required** — to see your own entries, first upload a VCT in the Registry page.  
- **Visibility** — only you can change your entries; public catalog entries from others are read-only.  
- **Delete** — available only for your own entries.
